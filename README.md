<p align="justify">RETCAD is a software suite that can simulate FRET (F&ouml;rster Resonance Energy Transfer) in networks of chromophores. It is particularly useful in the analysis of multi-chromophore systems with shared acceptors, as in such systems, the kinetics of energy migration is often described by a <b>nonlinear</b> system of differential equations the solution of which is nontrivial to find.
